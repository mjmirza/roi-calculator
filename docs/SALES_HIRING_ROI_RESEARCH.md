- **Top Performers:** 70%+ of team hitting quota

**Gap Analysis:** There's a significant gap between "good" (60-80%) and current reality (43-50%), suggesting many organizations set overly aggressive quotas.

**Sources:** Everstage 2024, SaaStr, Forrester, Drivetrain.ai

### 1.4 Fully Loaded Cost of Sales Rep

#### Cost Formula
**Fully Loaded Cost = Base Salary × 1.25 to 1.40**

Or more precisely:
**Fully Loaded Cost = Base Salary + Benefits (20-30%) + Payroll Taxes (7.65%) + Tools ($2,940/yr) + Overhead (10-40%)**

#### Cost Breakdown
| Component | Percentage of Base | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Base Salary | 100% | Foundation |
| Benefits | 20-30% | Health insurance, 401k, PTO |
| Payroll Taxes | 7.65%+ | Federal minimum (FICA), state varies |
| Sales Tools | ~2-3% | CRM, sales engagement, communication |
| Office Overhead | 10-40% | Office space, utilities, equipment |
| **Total Multiplier** | **125-140%** | **Rule of thumb** |

#### Example Calculation
- **AE Base:** $120,000
- **Fully Loaded:** $156,000 annually ($13,000/month)
- **Multiplier:** 130% of base

**Sources:** Virtual Latinos, Virtudesk, Markster.ai, US Bureau of Labor Statistics

### 1.5 When to Hire Next Sales Rep

#### Capacity Indicators

**Primary Signals (All Must Be Present):**
1. **Maxed Pipeline:** Deals plateau month-over-month despite increased effort
2. **Response Time Degradation:** Can't maintain regular touchpoints throughout sales cycle
3. **Team Burnout:** Activity metrics declining (fewer calls, emails, meetings)
4. **Sales Cycle Stretching:** Delayed follow-ups causing longer cycles
5. **Founder Bottleneck:** Founders spending 60-70% time on sales vs. strategy

**Quantitative Thresholds:**
- **SDRs:** Generating 17-22 opportunities/month consistently
- **AEs:** Managing 100-150 active accounts (capacity limit)
- **Pipeline Coverage:** Below 3x target (need 3x-4x for healthy pipeline)
- **Lead Response Time:** Increasing beyond 24-48 hour target
- **Conversion Rates:** Declining due to lack of attention

**Forward Planning Rule:**
Hire 3-6 months BEFORE you need capacity, accounting for ramp time. If you need capacity in Q4, hire in Q2.

## 2. Key Formulas

### 2.1 Sales Rep ROI Formula

#### Basic ROI
\`\`\`
ROI = (Revenue Generated - Total Investment Cost) / Total Investment Cost × 100%

Where:
- Revenue Generated = Total bookings closed by rep
- Total Investment Cost = Fully loaded cost + onboarding + tools
\`\`\`

#### Expected ROI Benchmark
**Target:** 3:1 to 5:1 ratio
- For every $1 invested, generate $3-$5 in profit
- Varies by industry, product complexity, and sales cycle

**Source:** Kennect, FullFunnel.co

### 2.2 Break-Even Timeline Calculation

#### Basic Break-Even Formula
\`\`\`
Break-Even Time = Total Investment Cost / Monthly Net Revenue Generated

Where:
- Total Investment Cost = (Fully Loaded Annual Cost × Ramp Time in Months / 12) + Onboarding Cost
- Monthly Net Revenue = (Monthly Bookings × Gross Margin%) - Monthly Fully Loaded Cost
\`\`\`

#### Month-by-Month Break-Even Tracking
\`\`\`
Month X Break-Even Status = Cumulative Revenue Generated - Cumulative Costs

Cumulative Costs = Σ(Monthly Salary + Benefits + Tools + Overhead + One-time Onboarding)
Cumulative Revenue = Σ(Monthly Quota Achieved × Quota Percentage × Gross Margin%)
\`\`\`

**Typical Break-Even:** 6-12 months for most B2B SaaS roles, depending on ramp time and quota.

### 2.3 Capacity Utilization Formula

#### Sales Capacity
\`\`\`
Sales Capacity = Number of Reps × Quota per Rep × Average Quota Attainment

More Advanced:
Effective Capacity = Total Reps × % Ramped × Avg Quota Attainment × (1 - Turnover Rate)
\`\`\`

#### Accounts Per Rep Capacity
\`\`\`
Max Accounts per Rep = Available Working Hours / Hours per Account

Where:
- Available Working Hours ≈ 1,800 hours/year (after meetings, admin, training)
- Hours per Account = (Avg Sales Cycle Length × Touchpoints × Time per Touch)
\`\`\`

**Benchmarks:**
- **SDR/BDR:** 88-150 accounts at a time (TOPO research)
- **AE:** 100-150 active accounts maximum
- **Enterprise AE:** 10-40 accounts (higher complexity)

**Source:** Winning by Design, TOPO, Gradient Works

### 2.4 Revenue Per Rep Calculations

#### Average Revenue Per Sales Employee
\`\`\`
Revenue per Rep = Total Revenue / Number of Sales Reps

Benchmarks:
- Private B2B SaaS: $130,000 median ARR per employee (all employees)
- Public SaaS: $190,000-$210,000 per employee
- Growth Rate: +26% YoY or +$21k/year (median)
\`\`\`

#### Sales Quota Per Rep
\`\`\`
Individual Quota = Revenue Target / (Number of Ramped Reps × Expected Quota Attainment %)

Example:
$2M revenue target / (3 reps × 65% attainment) = $1,026,000 per rep quota
\`\`\`

**Source:** SaaS Capital 2025, Blossom Street Ventures

### 2.5 Cost Per Deal with New Hire

#### Cost Per Deal Formula
\`\`\`
Cost per Deal = Total Sales Costs / Number of Deals Closed

Total Sales Costs = Σ(All Sales Rep Costs + Sales Tools + Overhead + Management)
\`\`\`

#### Marginal Cost Per Deal (New Hire)
\`\`\`
Marginal Cost per Deal = Incremental Cost of New Hire / Incremental Deals Closed

Where:
- Incremental Cost = Fully loaded annual cost of new hire
- Incremental Deals = Expected deals closed by new hire in Year 1
\`\`\`

#### Example Calculation
- **New AE Cost:** $156,000 fully loaded
- **Ramp:** 6 months to full productivity
- **Annual Quota:** $800,000
- **Expected Attainment:** 60% (ramping)
- **Expected Revenue:** $480,000
- **Average Deal Size:** $60,000
- **Deals Closed:** 8 deals
- **Cost per Deal:** $156,000 / 8 = **$19,500 per deal**

### 2.6 Productivity Ramp Curve Formulas

#### Quarterly Ramp Model (Common Assumption)
\`\`\`
Q1: 0% of quota
Q2: 25% of quota
Q3: 50% of quota
Q4: 100% of quota
\`\`\`

#### Empirical Quarterly Model (More Realistic)
\`\`\`
Q1: 10% of quota
Q2: 38% of quota
Q3: 76% of quota
Q4: 85% of quota
Q5: 98% of quota
\`\`\`

#### Monthly Ramp Model (SDR - 3 months)
\`\`\`
Month 1: 25% productivity
Month 2: 50% productivity
Month 3: 75% productivity
Month 4+: 100% productivity
\`\`\`

#### Monthly Ramp Model (AE - 6 months)
\`\`\`
Month 1-2: 15% productivity
Month 3: 35% productivity
Month 4: 55% productivity
Month 5: 75% productivity
Month 6: 90% productivity
Month 7+: 100% productivity

### 3.3 Enterprise vs SMB Ramp Differences

#### Sales Cycle Length Impact

| Segment | Sales Cycle | Ramp Time | Decision Makers | AE Experience Required |
|---------|-------------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| **SMB** | 30-90 days | 3-4 months | 1-2 | Entry to mid-level |
| **Mid-Market** | 3-6 months | 4-6 months | 3-5 | Mid to senior |
| **Enterprise** | 6-18 months | 6-12 months | 6-10 | Senior, specialized |

#### Key Differences

**SMB Sales:**
- Faster ramp (3-4 months)
- Lower average deal size ($5K-$15K transactional)
- Shorter sales cycle (3 months average)
- 1-2 decision makers
- Higher volume of deals
- Less sophisticated AEs needed

**Enterprise Sales:**
- Longer ramp (6-12 months minimum)
- Higher deal size ($100K+ ACV)
- Extended sales cycle (6-18 months)
- 6-10 decision makers
- Complex approval processes
- Legal and compliance reviews
- Requires experienced AEs with enterprise background
- Fewer opportunities to iterate/practice
- Higher stakes per deal

**Ramp Time Formula:**
\`\`\`
Average Ramp Time = Sales Cycle Length + 90 days

Examples:
- SMB (90-day cycle): 90 + 90 = 180 days (6 months)
- Enterprise (180-day cycle): 180 + 90 = 270 days (9 months)
\`\`\`

## 4. Hiring Decision Metrics

### 4.1 Pipeline Coverage Ratios

#### Standard Benchmark
**Optimal Range:** 3x to 4x target

\`\`\`
Pipeline Coverage Ratio = Total Pipeline Value / Revenue Target

Example:
$3M pipeline / $1M target = 3x coverage
\`\`\`

**Interpretation:**
- **< 3x:** Undersized pipeline, at risk of missing goals
- **3x - 4x:** Healthy pipeline coverage
- **> 4x:** May indicate stagnating opportunities or over-forecasting

#### Adjustments by Sales Cycle
- **Short cycle (< 60 days):** 2x - 3x coverage acceptable
- **Standard cycle (60-120 days):** 3x - 4x coverage
- **Long cycle (120+ days):** 4x - 5x+ coverage needed

**Source:** Mosaic.tech, ForecastIO, BoostUp

### 4.2 When Current Team is at Capacity

#### SDR Capacity Indicators

**Quantitative Signals:**
- Consistently generating 17-22+ opportunities/month
- Contact attempts > 80 calls/day sustained
- Email volume > 100 personalized emails/day
- Working 100-150 active accounts (upper limit)
- SQL to opportunity conversion > 50%
- Can't maintain 7-8 touchpoints per prospect in cadence

**Qualitative Signals:**
- Response times to leads > 24 hours
- Prospect follow-up falling through cracks
- Burnout symptoms (declining activity)

**Hire Trigger:** When SDR sustains max activity for 60-90 days

#### AE Capacity Indicators

**Quantitative Signals:**
- Managing 100-150+ active opportunities (max capacity)
- Pipeline coverage dropping below 3x
- Sales cycle length increasing > 20%
- Win rate declining due to lack of attention
- Unable to maintain regular touchpoints
- Average of < 1 hour prep per customer meeting

**Qualitative Signals:**
- Deals going cold from delayed follow-up
- Missing key buying signals
- Unable to multi-thread within accounts
- Proposals/quotes delayed > 48 hours

**Capacity Formula:**
\`\`\`
Max Active Opportunities = Available Selling Hours / Hours per Opportunity

Where:
- Available Selling Hours ≈ 100-120 hours/month (after internal meetings)
- Hours per Opportunity = 3-5 hours/month (for active deals)
Result: 25-35 active opportunities max
\`\`\`

**Hire Trigger:** When AE sustains 100+ active opps for 2+ months OR pipeline coverage < 3x for 2 quarters

**Source:** Gradient Works, Outreach, SaaStr

### 4.3 Lead-to-Opportunity Conversion Rates

#### B2B SaaS Benchmarks

| Conversion Stage | Benchmark Rate | Top Performer | Time to Convert |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Lead → Opportunity | 10-15% | 20%+ | 84 days avg |
| Lead → Appointment | Variable | - | - |
| Appointment → Opportunity | 38% | 50%+ | - |
| Opportunity → Customer | 13-25% | 30%+ | 79 days (SaaS) |

#### By Channel Performance

**Highest Converting Channels:**
1. **Company Website:** 31.3% (lead → opportunity)
2. **Referrals:** 25-30% estimated
3. **Webinars:** 17.8% (lead → opportunity)
4. **Email Marketing:** 5-15%
5. **Cold Outbound:** 1-3%

**Key Insight:** Some channels create opportunities more easily, but those opportunities may be lower quality (lower close rates). Balance quantity with quality.

#### Capacity Planning Use

\`\`\`
Leads Needed = Revenue Target / (Avg Deal Size × Lead-to-Customer %)

Example:
$1M target / ($50K deal × 2% lead-to-customer) = 1,000 leads needed
\`\`\`

**Source:** First Page Sage, Callin.io, Powered by Search

### 4.4 Optimal Team Size Calculations

#### Revenue-Based Method

**Basic Formula:**
\`\`\`
Number of Reps = Revenue Target / (Avg Quota per Rep × Expected Attainment %)

Example:
$5M target / ($800K quota × 65% attainment) = 9.6 ≈ 10 AEs
\`\`\`

**Advanced Formula (Accounts for Ramp & Turnover):**
\`\`\`
Required Reps = Revenue Target / (Avg Quota × Attainment % × (1 - Turnover %) × % Ramped)

Example with ramp/turnover:
$5M / ($800K × 0.65 × 0.85 × 0.80) = 14 AEs needed
\`\`\`

#### Workload-Based Method

\`\`\`
Number of Reps = Total Addressable Accounts / Max Accounts per Rep

Example:
2,000 target accounts / 125 accounts per rep = 16 reps needed
\`\`\`

#### Rule of Thumb
**B2B SaaS:** 1 sales rep per $1M-$2M in revenue (varies by segment)

#### Team Structure Ratios

**SDR : AE Ratio**
- **Current Benchmark:** 1 SDR : 2.3-2.6 AEs
- **Historical:** Was 1 : 3.9 in 2014, has tightened significantly
- **High-growth companies:** 1 : 2 ratio more common

**AE : Account Manager Ratio**
- **Typical:** 2-3 AEs : 1 AM
- **Depends on:** Customer complexity, expansion opportunity

**Sales : Sales Management Ratio**
- **Standard:** 8-10 reps : 1 manager
- **Range:** 5-12 reps per manager
- **New reps need more:** 5-6 : 1 during heavy ramp periods

### 4.5 Sales to Support Staff Ratios

#### Spending as % of ARR (2024 Benchmarks)

| Department | Bootstrapped | Equity-Backed | Notes |
|------------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Sales | Lower baseline | 89% higher spend | Major difference |
| Customer Success | Lower baseline | 14% higher spend | More modest gap |
| **Total Spend** | 95% of ARR | 107% of ARR | Net burn in growth phase |

**Interpretation:** Venture-backed companies invest significantly more in sales capacity earlier, while bootstrapped companies scale more conservatively.

#### Sales Support Roles

**Typical B2B SaaS Team Structure (50-100 employees):**
- **Sales Reps:** 20-30 (SDRs, AEs, AMs combined)
- **Sales Engineers:** 2-4 (for technical sales)
- **Sales Operations:** 1-2 (for process, tools, reporting)
- **Sales Enablement:** 1-2 (training, content, onboarding)
- **Revenue Operations:** 1-3 (cross-functional planning)

**Ratios:**
- **Sales Engineer : AE:** 1 SE : 4-6 AEs (technical products)
- **Sales Ops : Sales Rep:** 1 Ops : 15-20 reps
- **Sales Enablement : Rep:** 1 Enablement : 25-30 reps

#### ARR to Headcount Ratio

**Rule of Thumb:** $100K ± $50K ARR per employee (all employees, not just sales)

**By Stage:**
- **Early startup:** < $50K per employee (investing in growth)
- **Growth stage:** $75K-$150K per employee
- **Mature/Bootstrapped:** $200K+ per employee

### 5.6 Manager Time Investment

#### Coaching Time Benchmarks

**Standard Recommendation:** 25-40% of manager's time on coaching

#### Time Allocation by Rep Stage

**New Reps (First 3-6 Months):**
- **Minimum:** 3-5 hours/week per new rep
- **Optimal:** 5-8 hours/week per new rep
- **Activities:**
  - 1-on-1 meetings: 1-2 hours/week
  - Call/demo reviews: 2-3 hours/week
  - Field coaching (shadowing): 1-2 hours/week
  - Deal coaching: 1-2 hours/week

**Ramped Reps (Fully Productive):**
- **Standard:** 1-2 hours/week per rep
- **High performers:** 0.5-1 hour/week
- **Struggling reps:** 2-3 hours/week

#### Impact of Coaching Time on Performance

| Weekly Coaching Hours | Win Rate | Performance Impact |
|----------------------|----------|-------------------|
| ≤ 30 minutes | 43% | Below average |
| 1 hour | 48% | Average |
| 2+ hours | 56% | High performance (+30% vs. minimal) |

#### Manager Capacity Planning

**Optimal Rep-to-Manager Ratio:**
- **All ramped reps:** 8-10 reps per manager
- **Mixed team (some ramping):** 6-8 reps per manager
- **Heavy ramp period:** 5-6 reps per manager

**Calculation Example:**
- Manager has 8 reps
- 2 new reps (4 hours each/week) = 8 hours
- 6 ramped reps (1 hour each/week) = 6 hours
- **Total coaching time:** 14 hours/week (35% of 40-hour week)

#### Cost of Manager Time Investment

**Manager Time Cost:**
- Sales Manager comp: $150,000 - $250,000 OTE
- Hourly rate: $75 - $125/hour
- 5 hours/week on new rep = $375 - $625/week = $1,500 - $2,500/month
- Over 6-month ramp: $9,000 - $15,000 in manager time per new hire

**Hidden Cost:** When managers don't invest enough time:
- Ramp time extends 1-3 months (cost: $13,000 - $40,000 in lost productivity)
- Increased turnover risk (cost: 50-100% of salary to replace)
- Lower quota attainment (cost: $50,000 - $200,000 in missed revenue)

**ROI of Proper Coaching:**
Reps with 2+ hours coaching/week have 56% win rate vs. 43% with minimal coaching = +30% performance = $150,000+ additional revenue per rep annually.

| Role/Segment | Average Deal Size (ACV) | Deal Range | Annual Quota |
|--------------|------------------------|------------|--------------|
| SDR | N/A (pipeline, not deals) | $25K - $100K (pipeline) | $3M pipeline |
| AE (SMB) | $5,000 - $15,000 | $3K - $25K | $400K - $600K |
| AE (Mid-Market) | $30,000 - $80,000 | $25K - $100K | $700K - $1M |
| AE (Enterprise) | $100,000 - $500,000+ | $75K - $1M+ | $1M - $2M+ |
| Account Manager | $20,000 - $100,000 | Expansion/Upsell | $500K - $800K |

**Key Benchmarks:**
- **Median ACV (2024 Bridge Group):** $52,000
- **Typical Mid-Market Deal:** $60,000
- **Enterprise Deal:** $100,000 - $250,000 average

#### Deals Per Rep Per Year

**Formula:**
\`\`\`
Deals per Year = Annual Quota / Average Deal Size

Examples:
- SMB AE: $500K quota / $10K deal = 50 deals/year (4.2/month)
- Mid-Market AE: $800K quota / $60K deal = 13.3 deals/year (1.1/month)
- Enterprise AE: $1.5M quota / $200K deal = 7.5 deals/year (0.6/month)
\`\`\`

#### By Role Annual Deal Volume

| Role | Deals/Year | Deals/Quarter | Deals/Month | Notes |
|------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| SMB AE | 40-60 | 10-15 | 3-5 | High velocity |
| Mid-Market AE | 10-15 | 2-4 | 0.8-1.3 | Standard SaaS |
| Enterprise AE | 5-10 | 1-3 | 0.4-0.8 | Complex, large deals |

| **SMB/Transactional** | 30-90 days | 30-120 days | 2-4 meetings, simple approvals |
| **Mid-Market AE** | 3-6 months | 60-180 days | 4-8 meetings, multiple stakeholders |
| **Enterprise AE** | 6-18 months | 120-540 days | 10-20+ meetings, complex procurement |
| **Account Manager** (upsell) | 30-90 days | 14-120 days | Existing relationship advantage |

#### Industry Benchmarks
- **B2B SaaS Average:** 79 days (2.6 months)
- **B2B Media:** 80 days
- **Professional Services:** 41 days
- **Overall B2B Average:** 84 days

#### Sales Cycle Stages & Duration

**Total:** 60-123 days (average 90 days)

#### Impact on Capacity Planning

\`\`\`
Max Active Opportunities per AE = (Sales Cycle in Months) × (Deals Needed per Month) × 3

Example (Mid-Market AE):

- **≤30 minutes:** 43% win rate
- **1 hour:** 48% win rate (baseline)
- **2+ hours:** 56% win rate (+30% improvement)

#### Calculation of Opportunities Needed

\`\`\`
Opportunities Needed = Deals Required / Win Rate

Examples:

Annual Quota: $800,000
Average Deal Size: $60,000
Deals Needed: $800K / $60K = 13.3 deals/year
Win Rate: 20%
Opportunities Needed: 13.3 / 0.20 = 67 opportunities/year (5.6/month)
Sales Cycle: 90 days (3 months)
Active Pipeline: 67 × (3/12) × 3 = 50 opportunities needed in pipeline
\`\`\`

**Capacity Check:**
- 50 active opportunities × 4 hours/opp/month = 200 hours/month
- Available selling time: 120 hours/month
- **Result:** Over capacity, can only handle ~30 active opps

#### Performance Distribution

Net Revenue Retention (NRR) = (Starting ARR + Expansion - Churn) / Starting ARR × 100%

Target NRR: 110-130% (best-in-class SaaS)
\`\`\`

**Example:**
- Starting ARR: $1,000,000

### 7.3 Revenue Per Sales Employee

See Section 7.1 above - consolidated for clarity.

**Key Benchmarks:**
- **Overall Company:** $130K - $210K per FTE (all departments)
- **Sales Department Specific:** Higher expectations
- **SDR:** $3M pipeline → ~$600K in closed revenue (at 20% close rate)
- **AE:** $500K - $1.5M in new ARR depending on segment

### 7.4 SaaS vs Traditional B2B Differences

#### Revenue Model Differences

**SaaS:**
- **MRR/ARR:** Recurring revenue model
- **Metrics Focus:** MRR, ARR, NRR, LTV:CAC
- **Sales Cycle:** Generally shorter for SMB/mid-market (30-180 days)
- **Commission:** Based on ACV, paid at booking or on revenue recognition
- **Customer Success:** Critical for retention and expansion

**Traditional B2B:**
- **One-Time Deals:** Perpetual licenses or project-based
- **Metrics Focus:** Deal size, gross revenue, project margin
- **Sales Cycle:** Often longer, more complex (90-365+ days)
- **Commission:** Typically on total contract value, paid at signature
- **Account Management:** Transactional, less ongoing relationship

#### Sales Productivity Differences

**SaaS Sales:**
- **Product-Led Growth Option:** Some customers self-serve, sales assists
- **Demo to Close Ratio:** 15-20% (4-6 demos per closed deal)
- **Expansion Revenue:** 10-30% of total ARR from existing customers
- **Sales Velocity:** Faster iteration, shorter initial deals
- **Metrics Tracked:** Activity-heavy (emails, calls, demos, trials)

**Traditional B2B:**
- **Sales-Led Only:** All revenue through sales team
- **Proposal Win Rate:** 20-30% typically
- **Repeat Business:** Varies widely by industry
- **Deal Size:** Often larger initial contracts
- **Metrics Tracked:** Pipeline value, proposal win rate, deal size

#### Cost Structure Differences

**SaaS Sales & Marketing Spend:**
- **Combined Budget:** 30-50% of revenue in growth phase
- **Split:** ~30% marketing, ~70% sales (traditional wisdom)
- **CAC Payback:** 12-18 months target
- **LTV:CAC Ratio:** 3:1 minimum, 5:1+ ideal

**Traditional B2B:**
- **Combined Budget:** 15-30% of revenue (more efficient, less growth-focused)
- **Higher Gross Margins:** 50-70% vs. SaaS 70-85%
- **Upfront Revenue:** Easier cash flow management

## 8. Calculator Outputs Framework

### 8.1 When to Hire (Capacity Indicators)

#### Input Variables
- Current team size (by role)
- Current team pipeline coverage
- Lead response time
- Conversion rates trending
- Average deals per rep per month
- Sales cycle length
- Team burnout signals (activity decline)

#### Capacity Score Algorithm

\`\`\`javascript
function calculateCapacityScore(inputs) {
  let score = 0;
  const weights = {
    pipelineCoverage: 25,     // Most important
    activityTrend: 20,
    conversionRate: 15,
    responseTime: 15,
    dealsPerRep: 15,
    burnoutSignals: 10
  };

  // Pipeline Coverage (3x-4x is healthy)
  if (inputs.pipelineCoverage < 2.5) score += weights.pipelineCoverage * 1.0;
  else if (inputs.pipelineCoverage < 3.0) score += weights.pipelineCoverage * 0.7;
  else if (inputs.pipelineCoverage > 5.0) score += weights.pipelineCoverage * 0.3; // Stagnant pipeline

  // Activity Trend (declining = need help)
  if (inputs.activityTrend < -10) score += weights.activityTrend * 1.0;
  else if (inputs.activityTrend < 0) score += weights.activityTrend * 0.5;

  // Conversion Rate Trend
  if (inputs.conversionTrend < -15) score += weights.conversionRate * 1.0;
  else if (inputs.conversionTrend < 0) score += weights.conversionRate * 0.5;

  // Lead Response Time (>24h bad for SMB, >48h bad for mid-market)
  if (inputs.avgResponseHours > 48) score += weights.responseTime * 1.0;
  else if (inputs.avgResponseHours > 24) score += weights.responseTime * 0.6;

  // Deals Per Rep (vs. capacity)
  const capacityUtilization = inputs.currentDealsPerRep / inputs.maxDealsPerRep;
  if (capacityUtilization > 0.9) score += weights.dealsPerRep * 1.0;
  else if (capacityUtilization > 0.75) score += weights.dealsPerRep * 0.5;

  // Burnout Signals
  if (inputs.burnoutSignals >= 3) score += weights.burnoutSignals * 1.0;
  else if (inputs.burnoutSignals >= 2) score += weights.burnoutSignals * 0.5;

  return score; // 0-100 score
}

// Interpretation:
// 0-30: Healthy capacity, monitor
// 31-60: Consider hiring in 3-6 months
// 61-80: Hire within 1-3 months
// 81-100: Hire immediately, capacity crisis
\`\`\`

- Risk: May miss opportunities in Q[X] without additional capacity

**Capacity Score: 61-80 (Urgent)**
- Status: At or over capacity
- Action: Hire within 30-60 days
- Forecast: Currently leaving revenue on table
- Impact: Estimated $[X] in pipeline at risk

**Capacity Score: 81-100 (Critical)**
- Status: Severe capacity constraint
- Action: Hire immediately, consider 2+ reps
- Forecast: Significant revenue loss occurring
- Impact: Losing est. $[X]/month in opportunities

### 8.2 ROI Timeline (Month by Month)

#### Month-by-Month Projection Template

\`\`\`javascript

### 8.3 Break-Even Point

#### Break-Even Calculation

\`\`\`javascript
function calculateBreakEven(inputs) {
  const monthlyData = calculateMonthlyROI(inputs);

  // Find first month where cumulative net profit >= 0
  const breakEvenMonth = monthlyData.findIndex(m => m.cumulativeNetProfit >= 0) + 1;

  if (breakEvenMonth === 0) {
    return {
      breaksEven: false,
      message: "Does not break even within 24-month projection",
      recommendAction: "Reevaluate quota, commission structure, or role necessity"
    };
  }

  const breakEvenData = monthlyData[breakEvenMonth - 1];

  return {
    breaksEven: true,
    breakEvenMonth,
    totalCostToBreakEven: breakEvenData.cumulativeCost,
    totalRevenueAtBreakEven: breakEvenData.cumulativeRevenue,
    message: `Breaks even in month ${breakEvenMonth}`,
    paybackPeriod: `${breakEvenMonth} months`,

    // First year summary
    year1CumulativeCost: monthlyData[11].cumulativeCost,
    year1CumulativeRevenue: monthlyData[11].cumulativeRevenue,
    year1NetProfit: monthlyData[11].cumulativeNetProfit,
    year1ROI: monthlyData[11].roi
  };
}
\`\`\`

#### Break-Even Benchmarks

**By Role:**
- **SDR:** 4-6 months (shorter ramp, lower cost)
- **Mid-Market AE:** 6-9 months (standard ramp, medium cost)
- **Enterprise AE:** 9-15 months (long ramp, high cost, large deals)
- **Account Manager:** 5-8 months (faster ramp, existing relationships)

**Factors Influencing Break-Even:**
1. Ramp time (longer = later break-even)
2. OTE (higher = more cost to recover)
3. Quota (higher = faster recovery if achieved)
4. Quota attainment % (realistic expectations)
5. Gross margin (higher = more profit per dollar)
6. Onboarding costs (one-time hit to payback)

### 8.4 12-Month Revenue Projection

#### Projection Formula

\`\`\`javascript
function calculate12MonthProjection(inputs) {
  const monthlyData = calculateMonthlyROI(inputs);
  const first12Months = monthlyData.slice(0, 12);

  // Aggregate metrics
  const totalRevenue = first12Months.reduce((sum, m) => sum + parseFloat(m.monthlyRevenue), 0);
  const totalGrossProfit = first12Months.reduce((sum, m) => sum + parseFloat(m.monthlyGrossProfit), 0);
  const totalCost = first12Months.reduce((sum, m) => sum + parseFloat(m.monthCost), 0);
  const totalNetProfit = totalGrossProfit - totalCost;

  const avgProductivity = first12Months.reduce((sum, m) =>
    sum + parseFloat(m.productivityPercent), 0) / 12;

  return {
    totalRevenue: totalRevenue.toFixed(0),
    totalGrossProfit: totalGrossProfit.toFixed(0),
    totalCost: totalCost.toFixed(0),
    totalNetProfit: totalNetProfit.toFixed(0),
    roi: ((totalNetProfit / totalCost) * 100).toFixed(1) + '%',
    avgProductivity: avgProductivity.toFixed(0) + '%',
    breaksEven: totalNetProfit >= 0,

    // Performance vs. expectations
    quotaAchievement: (totalRevenue / inputs.quota * 100).toFixed(0) + '%',

    // Quarterly breakdown
    q1: {
      revenue: first12Months.slice(0,3).reduce((sum, m) => sum + parseFloat(m.monthlyRevenue), 0),
      productivity: first12Months.slice(0,3).reduce((sum, m) => sum + parseFloat(m.productivityPercent), 0) / 3
    },
    q2: {
      revenue: first12Months.slice(3,6).reduce((sum, m) => sum + parseFloat(m.monthlyRevenue), 0),
      productivity: first12Months.slice(3,6).reduce((sum, m) => sum + parseFloat(m.productivityPercent), 0) / 3
    },
    q3: {
      revenue: first12Months.slice(6,9).reduce((sum, m) => sum + parseFloat(m.monthlyRevenue), 0),
      productivity: first12Months.slice(6,9).reduce((sum, m) => sum + parseFloat(m.productivityPercent), 0) / 3
    },
    q4: {
      revenue: first12Months.slice(9,12).reduce((sum, m) => sum + parseFloat(m.monthlyRevenue), 0),
      productivity: first12Months.slice(9,12).reduce((sum, m) => sum + parseFloat(m.productivityPercent), 0) / 3
    }
  };
}
\`\`\`

#### Example Output

**Mid-Market AE - 12 Month Projection:**

\`\`\`
Total Revenue Generated: $480,000
Total Gross Profit: $384,000
Total Cost (fully loaded): $233,000
Total Net Profit: $151,000
First Year ROI: +65%
Average Productivity: 62%
Quota Achievement: 60% (realistic for first year with ramp)

Quarterly Breakdown:
Q1: $40,000 revenue (17% avg productivity) - Heavy ramp period
Q2: $110,000 revenue (52% avg productivity) - Accelerating
Q3: $170,000 revenue (85% avg productivity) - Near full productivity
Q4: $160,000 revenue (95% avg productivity) - Full productivity
\`\`\`

**Interpretation:**
- First year is profitable despite 6-month ramp
- Achieves 60% of annual quota (reasonable for Year 1)
- Strong Q3-Q4 performance justifies hire
- Year 2 projection: ~$720K-$800K (90-100% quota)

### Visualization Requirements

**Charts Needed:**
1. Month-by-month revenue vs. cost (dual-axis line chart)
2. Cumulative ROI progression (line chart with break-even marker)
3. Productivity ramp curve (area chart)
4. Hire vs. No-Hire scenario comparison (bar chart)
5. First-year quarterly performance (column chart)

**Key Metrics Display:**
- Break-even month (highlighted)
- 12-month ROI %
- Total Year 1 revenue
- Total Year 1 cost
- Net profit/loss Year 1
- Capacity score (gauge)

### Validation Rules

1. Quota should be 4-7x OTE (warn if outside)
2. Base+Variable should equal OTE (validate)
3. Ramp time should be reasonable for role (3-12 months)
4. Gross margin typically 70-85% for SaaS (warn if outside)
5. Benefits % typically 20-35% (warn if outside)
